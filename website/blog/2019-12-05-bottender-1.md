We're very proud to announce the production-ready **Bottender v1** today, featuring:

- Create bottender app
- New primitive - Action
- Conversation router
- Recursive action runner
- Migrated to lerna monorepo
- Rewritten with TypeScript
- New Bottender.js.org
- Simplified HTTP adapter APIs

Checkout v1 [changelog]() and [migration guide](https://bottender.js.org/docs/migrating-v1) for more details.

## Create Bottender App

Create Bottender App is the best way to start building a new application in Bottender. You can start a multiple channels bot with only one command:

```sh
$ npx create-bottender-app my-app
```

It saves much your time from installing packages and writing boilerplates.

## Conversation Made Easy and Simple

When developing Bottender v1, we found that it's still a challenge to write complicated messaging applications and keep code easy to read.

So, we introduced a new primitive - "Action". Actions are the smallest building blocks of Bottender apps:

```js
async function SayHi(context) {
  await context.sendText('Hi!');
}
```

After having this, our user can really benefit from the functional declarative world.

You may notice that we retarget Bottender as "A framework for building conversational user interfaces". We are ready to optimize the way we build the conversation.

### Conversation Router

With Bottender v1, you can use the new `router` to organize your conversations:

```js
const { router, text } = require('bottender/router');

async function SayHi(context) {
  await context.sendText('Hi!');
}

async function Unknown(context) {
  await context.sendText('Sorry, I donâ€™t know what you say.');
}

module.export = function App(context) {
  return router([
    text('hi', SayHi), //
    text('*', Unknown),
  ]);
};
```

It's declarative and easy yo read. Also, the way to debug it is very straightforward.

### Runner

Bottender v1 bring a new bulit-in action runner in the core. The only thing you need to do is returning the action and then Bottender will execute your actions recursively:

```js
const { withProps } = require('bottender');

const { router, text } = require('bottender/router');

async function SayHi(context, { name }) {
  await context.sendText(`Hi! ${name}.`);
}

async function SayHiToJohn(context) {
  return withProps(SayHi, { name: 'John' });
}

async function App(context) {
  return router([
    text('hi', SayHiToJohn), //
    text('*', Unknown),
  ]);
}
```

This functionality provides possibilities and unblocks building a lot of cool features. For example, you may use debug environment variable `DEBUG=bottender:action` to debug how your app handling events:

## Integrating with Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a key component in the modern messaging applications. Thanks to the machine learning and deep learning techniques, science has made great progress in the area of understanding human language during the last few years.

Consequently, we rethink the best practices about how to use NLU techniques with Bottender and write those
official guides and examples for the following popular NLU providers:

- [Dialogflow](https://bottender.js.org/docs/advanced-guides-nlu#building-with-dialogflow)
- [QnA Maker](https://bottender.js.org/docs/advanced-guides-nlu#building-with-qna-maker)
- [LUIS](https://bottender.js.org/docs/advanced-guides-nlu#building-with-luis)
- [Rasa](https://bottender.js.org/docs/advanced-guides-nlu#building-with-rasa-nlu)

## Fundamentally Rewrite with TypeScript

Static typing in JavaScript is one of the most impactful trending in the last few years. We adapt it It can dramatically improve the code reliability.

We choose flow type two years ago.

## Bottender.js.org

We are very happy to introduce the new bottender.js.org, built by Bottender core contributor [Evan Ye](https://github.com/jigsawye).

Several team members were dedicated to writing. And it always more docs are coming soon.

### Versioned Documents and Search Box

The new bottender.js.org is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and [Docsearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/).

All documents are versioned and can be searched by heading:

## What's Next

There are still a lot of features that we want to delivery in Bottender v1. You can keep an eye on our roadmap in [this issue](https://github.com/Yoctol/bottender/issues/435).

### Slot Filling

The most common way to achieve multi-turns conversations is implementing them with slot filling.

We already experimented this in the past few months and made great progress. Going further, we can even deeply integrate DialogFlow by using parameters defined by DialogFlow.

### Serverless Support

By Simplified HTTP adapter APIs
